      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Neza Idrissa, a high school student in Kigali with a deep interest in research, environmental awareness, and social storytelling. I believe that young people can shape their communities through education, action, and voice. I work on raising awareness about climate change, mentorship, and digital responsibility among youth.

      <h2>My Vision</h2>
      <p>
        I want to be a changemaker. My dream is to work in a space where education, policy, and media come together to support African youth in making sustainable, informed choices. Every project I do — whether it’s a video, article, or event — is a step toward building that future.
